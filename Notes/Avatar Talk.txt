code slide 1:

• Describe code
• Code we likely have all written.
• Might even be in multiple places in a single app.
† Focus on lines 60-62 in ViewController.swift

code slide 2:

• Split to two screens and describe how code was refactored into separate function.
• Some probably have a function like this as well.
• Talk about reuse potential
† But we're here to talk about Promises.

code slide 3:

• Quick introduction to promises.
  • Encapsulate a future result
  • Allows callbacks to return values and throw exceptions, as well as perform side effects.
• Describe how function has been changed to use a promise instead of a callback.
† Promise isn't strictly needed here (don't care about the result) but in the next slide...

code slide 4:

• But here we do...
• Describe how `choiceIndexUsingActionSheet` works.
  • Takes care of entire user interaction from alert presentation to dismissal.
  • Returns the user's choice which is asynchronous.
• Describe how it is called.
  • `sourceOptions` is an array of String/Action tuples, but could be an array of anything.
  • Once we know the user's choice, we can act on it.
• Discuss the notion of encapsulating user interactions.
